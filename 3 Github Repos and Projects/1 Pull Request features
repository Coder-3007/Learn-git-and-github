Pull requests are a core feature of GitHub that facilitate collaboration and code review in software development. They allow developers to propose changes to a codebase, review others’ changes, and discuss modifications before they are merged into the main branch. Here are the key features of GitHub pull requests:

1. Code Comparison (Diff)
Pull requests show the differences between the source and target branches, highlighting the lines that have been added, modified, or removed.
2. Review Process
Reviewers: You can request specific people to review the pull request. Reviewers can approve changes, request modifications, or leave comments.
Comments and Discussions: Both inline and general comments can be left on pull requests. This enables detailed discussions about specific code lines or the overall change.
Suggestions: Inline comments can include suggested changes that the author can directly apply.
3. Checks and Statuses
Pull requests can be linked with Continuous Integration (CI) services to run automated tests or checks. The pull request page shows whether these checks have passed or failed.
4. Merge Options
Merge Commit: Creates a merge commit that combines the source branch with the target branch.
Squash and Merge: Combines all commits from the source branch into a single commit in the target branch.
Rebase and Merge: Reapplies commits from the source branch on top of the target branch without creating a merge commit.
5. Draft Pull Requests
Developers can create draft pull requests when a feature is still a work in progress. This signals to reviewers that the request isn’t ready for a final review but is open for feedback.
6. Branch Protection Rules
You can enforce branch protection rules that require pull requests to meet certain conditions (e.g., passing all checks, review approvals) before being merged.
7. Conflict Resolution
GitHub provides an interface to resolve merge conflicts directly within the pull request.
8. Linked Issues
Pull requests can be linked to issues, helping to track progress on bug fixes, features, or tasks. This ensures that the pull request is addressing a specific issue.
9. Commit History
The pull request shows a history of all commits that are part of the request, including when they were pushed and who made them.
10. Notifications and Integrations
GitHub provides notifications, webhooks, and integrations with other tools (like Slack) to alert team members when a pull request is created, updated, or merged.
These features make GitHub pull requests a powerful tool for managing code changes, encouraging collaboration, and maintaining code quality in a development workflow.
