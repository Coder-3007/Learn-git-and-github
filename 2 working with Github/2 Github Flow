GITHUB FLOW:


GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow designed to help developers work more efficiently and collaboratively on projects. It is a streamlined version of other Git workflows and is ideal for continuous delivery and deployment. GitHub Flow emphasizes simplicity and quick iterations, making it popular in open-source projects and teams that practice continuous integration.

Key Concepts of GitHub Flow
Master Branch as the Production Branch:

The main (or master) branch is always deployable and contains the production-ready code.
Every commit to main should be stable and tested.
Feature Branches:

Developers create new branches from main for each feature, bug fix, or task.
These branches are often named descriptively, such as feature/add-login, bugfix/fix-login-error, etc.
Commits:

Changes are committed to the feature branch with clear and concise commit messages.
Regular commits make it easier to track progress and rollback changes if necessary.
Pull Requests:

When the feature is complete, the developer opens a pull request (PR) to merge the feature branch into the main branch.
Pull requests facilitate code review and discussion among team members before merging.
Automated tests and continuous integration (CI) are often run on the pull request to ensure no issues are introduced.
Code Review:

Team members review the code in the pull request, provide feedback, and suggest improvements.
Once the code is approved, it can be merged into main.
Merging:

After a successful review and passing tests, the pull request is merged into main.
The main branch remains stable, with the new feature or fix integrated.
Deployment:

Once merged, the changes can be deployed to production directly from the main branch.
Since main is always deployable, this process is quick and ensures high-quality code in production.
Workflow Summary
Create a Branch:

git checkout -b feature-branch-name
Start with a new branch from the main branch for the task youâ€™re working on.

Make Commits:

git add .
git commit -m "Commit message describing the changes"
Develop your feature, making commits as you go.

Open a Pull Request:

Push your branch to GitHub:

git push origin feature-branch-name
Open a pull request on GitHub for code review and discussion.
Review and Discuss:

Collaborate with your team by reviewing the code and making any necessary changes based on feedback.
Merge and Deploy:

Once approved, merge the pull request into the main branch.
Deploy the code if needed.
